# ChangeGenerator

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate user input and output. The purpose of this assignment was to display the minimum amount of coins necessary to make up a user inputted value.

This implementation utilizes modulus and division operators and displays the amounts of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters for a user inputted change value.
